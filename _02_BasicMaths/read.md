<!-- All divisior method optimize concept -->
let n=36
Both are factors: 36%i=0 and 36/i=perfect integer
1 x 36
2 x 18 
3 x 12 
4 x 9
6 x 6
Both side are factors for number 36, so we can say that they are divisor of 36.
squareroot(36) =6 and let j=6 => j*j<=36 -> loop will  run half and consider both % and / factors.
<!--euclidean algorithm  -->
for a>b
gcd(a,b)=gcd(a-b, b)
in program it can be gcd(a,b)=gcd(a%b, b) therefore a= a%b
this logic used for gcd/hcf program no.08
